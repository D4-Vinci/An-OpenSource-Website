# An-OpenSource-Website
A simple Open Source Website

Anyone can join me in this journey to create a simple yet open source website like Wikipedia.
This website is to gain free knowledge.
Also Wikipedia has a trash UI/UX

The aim is to make a website that provides free knowledge in a way, even little kids can understand.
