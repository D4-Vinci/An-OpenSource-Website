# An-OpenSource-Website
A simple Open Source Website

Anyone can join me in this journey to create a simple yet open source website like Wikipedia.
This website is to gain free knowledge.
Also Wikipedia has a trash UI/UX 
//I'm not hating on Wikipedia. I use it from time to time, but I feel that we need something better.
//Concepts are harder to understand for the newcomers. As a portal for free knowledge, I believe it should also be easier to get it, hence this project.

The aim is to make a website that provides free knowledge in a way, even little kids can understand.
It will also be powered by AI for various purposes within itself.
